# Accidents-in-UK
### Overview
Road accidents have been a major concern for all the countries around the world. According to WHO approximately 1.3 million people die every year because of road traffic. These result in death and injuries of many people. Using data science could be helpful in identifying the major reasons of occurrence of accidents and help in resolving the problems. By using the Open Road Safety Data for past 5 years of UK (2016-2020) datasets, which are available in the government website, I will perform data analysis. The main aim of the project is to analyze the data, plot various Data Visualization graphs and implement different Machine Learning algorithms and finally evaluate the model that gives better accuracy in predicting the accidents severity which will help the police department to identify the reason for accidents and take necessary actions to provide safety of the people.
